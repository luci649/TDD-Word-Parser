# TDD-Word-Parser
This is a test driven development project that is based on an incomplete Java system that is then completed by me using the JUnit testing framework. In summary this system ment to analyse simple text files. This system analyses the frequency that unique individual characters and words occurre, creates a dictionary for the words in the text file, and misc stats such the longest, shortest word, word count, and last word read.
